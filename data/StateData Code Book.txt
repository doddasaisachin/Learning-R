STATE DATA CODE BOOK
============================================================

This dataset was compiled by Barton Poulson for demonstration purposes. It includes four categories of data for the 48 contiguous United States. 

SAMPLING NOTE: My goal was to make comparisons for the entire United States. However, the source for personality data did not report data for Alaska, Hawaii, or the District of Columbia. As a result, they were excluded from this dataset, leaving the 48 contiguous states in the dataset.

1. GEOGRAPHIC DATA

- State: The common name of the states

- state_code: The two-letter ANSI codes that are also used by the United States Postal Service. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_abbreviations. Retrieved 2018-07-26.)

- region: The 48 states are divided into the four Census Bureau-designated regions and divisions: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_regions. Retrieved 2018-07-26.)

2. POLITICAL DATA

- governor: Whether the state?fs governor as of 26 July 2018 was a Democrat or a Republican. (Note: Minnesota governor Mark Dayton is listed as "Democratic-Farmer-Labor" but was coded as "Democrat" for this dataset.

3. PERSONALITY DATA

- psychRegions: Three state-level personality profiles, coded as ?gFriendly and Conventional,?h ?gRelaxed and Creative,?h or ?gTemperamental and Uninhibited.?h

The next five personality variables are common psychological measures known as the ?gBig Five Personality Traits?h (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits). As is common with personality measures, the data are reported as T-scores, or scores that are standardized so that the mean is 50 and the standard deviation is 10 for each variable.

- extraversion: Extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)

- agreeableness: Agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)

- conscientiousness: Conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)

- neuroticism: Neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)

- openness: Openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)


(Note: Alaska, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia did not have data on the psychological regions and so they were excluded from this dataset. Source: ?gDivided We Stand: Three Psychological Regions of the United States and Their Political, Economic, Social, and Health Correlates"

4. GOOGLE SEARCH DATA

These are various Google search terms that were selected for their approximate relationship to the personality traits. The scores indicate the relative popularity of the search term on state-by-state basis. The data are reported as z-scores, or scores that are standardized so that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1 for each variable. States with a higher score used that search term in a higher proportion of their Google searches than did other states.

- instagram
- facebook
- retweet: ?gTwitter?h and ?gtweet?h do not return any results on Google Correlate, so ?gretweet?h was used as a surrogate.
- entrepreneur
- gdpr: ?gGeneral Data Protection Regulation,?h or the European Union?fs privacy law that affects all online businesses.
- privacy
- university
- mortgage
- volunteering: A loose indication of conscientiousness
- museum: A proxy for openness to experience, which often has aesthetic elements
- scrapbook: Another proxy for openness to experience
- modernDance: A third proxy for openness to experience. Written as ?gmodern dance?h in Google Correlate but joined for this dataset.
